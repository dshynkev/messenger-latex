# Messenger LaTeX 

This is a simple Chrome extension which recognizes and properly renders LaTeX markup in Facebook Messenger.

*This extension is now retired. Its functionality has been impemented in Messenger natively.*

## How to use it

Use LaTeX markup as you normally would.

Standalone LaTeX formulas are written like so: `$$ x + 1 $$`; inline â€” like so: `\( x + 1 \)`. To input literal `\(` and `\)`, escape the backslash like so: `\\( \\)`

To copy the LaTeX markup of a rendered equation, **click** right on it. The corresponding markup will be copied to your system's clipboard.
## Features
